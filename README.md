# Welcome to my page...nice to meet you! ðŸŽ‰

## About Me
I'm passionate about troubleshooting and solving tough problems. There's nothing more satisfying than delving into the heart of an issue, gaining a comprehensive understanding, and developing the perfect solution.

Throughout my career, I've embraced diverse roles in Operations Management, Quality Assurance, and Learning and Development, continuously seeking new ways to expand my skill set and horizons. This diverse experience has provided me with a valuable skill set for Software Engineering, centered on user experience, innovation, problem-solving, pragmatism, authenticity, efficiency, continuous growth, and persistence.

My fascination with software development began long ago, but it truly flourished when I delved into SQL for the first time. The experience of assembling millions of seemingly unrelated data pieces to uncover valuable insights ignited a deep passion within me. I became determined to elevate my skills and channel that obsession into creating software that delivers genuine value.

## Interests
An adventurer at heart, I find joy in spending time with my Shiba Inu, Boba, conquering indoor bouldering challenges, and expanding my knowledge through podcasts and books about personal development, programming, historical fiction, and epic fantasy. I also enjoy crafting new recipes, exploring new restaurants, coffee shops, and boba places, immersing myself in open-world RPGs, competing in FPS matches, playing puzzle games on my PS5 or Switch, and indulging in board games. My world is a constant journey of exploration and growth, where every moment brings the thrill of learning and embracing life's wonders. I find genuine excitement in trying new things and expanding my understanding of the world around me.
